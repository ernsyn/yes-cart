     * This method aims to standardise access to the prices realm, in terms of following
     * rules:
     *
     * 1. If product does not have a price as in price is <code>null</code> it is not purchasable.
     * 2. Zero price is used for things like gift and free of change items
     * 3. Sale price by nature cannot be higher than regular price (at least on frontend)
     *
     * This method will return correct regular and sale price provided settings of this
     * object.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Non purchasable product:
     * R: null, S: null results in [null, null]
     *
     * Standard use case only "Regular" price is provided
     * R: 100, S: null results in [100, null]
     *
     * Typical sale use case "Regular" is higher than "Sale"
     * R: 100, S: 80 results in [100, 80]
     *
     * Gift product:
     * R: 100, S: 0 results in [100, 0]
     *
     * Overpriced:
     * R: 100, S: 120 results in [120, null]
